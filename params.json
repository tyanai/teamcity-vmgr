This plugin enables you to add a remote execution for extracting runs information, reports data or even launching new sessions as part of your build process.\r\n\r\n### **Features**\r\n1. Free-style job plugin (can perform all vManager API call).\r\n1. Support static/dynamic API calls\r\n1. Support dynamic authentication per user id.\r\n1. Special build step for performing launch of vsif files dynamically.\r\n\r\n### **Limitations**\r\nThe plugin support for remote launching of vsif will be supported for Incisive 14.1 S5 and above.\r\n\r\n### **Configuration**\r\nAfter installing the plugin you'll get two new steps in the build step selection.\r\n![](https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6541847?v=3)\r\n* Choose \"vManager API\" if you need a free-style vAPI call to sends dynamic json input and receive a json output.\r\n* Choose \"vManager Session Launcher\" if you need to add a step for remote launching vsif (one or more).\r\n\r\n### **Usage**\r\n**vManager API**\r\n\r\nThe step takes care for the following:\r\n\r\n1. Authentication.\r\n2. Defining the API call.\r\n3. Defining the json input string for the API (static/dynamic).\r\n4. Saving the API result (json format) into the workspace. \r\nThe below is an example of defining a static vAPI call for getting a list of runs with session id equals to 1 or 2:\r\n\r\nThe below is an example of defining a dynamic vAPI call:\r\n\r\nIn case of a need in dynamically change the jSON input for the API per job, the pre-job should create a file with the relevant jSON string to be sent to the vAPI.\r\nThe input file can be placed anywhere within the agent accessible path . In case this field is empty, The file name need to be: ﻿﻿﻿$CHECKOUT_DIR/$BUILD_ID/vapi.input\r\n\r\nPlease fill this field only in case, you want to hard code the input file name, to be consist across all builds.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
